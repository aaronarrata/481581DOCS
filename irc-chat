ok.
What should I do next?
I'm so sorry. I'm a complete beginner at this, but I need Blender for this school project.

Increase the default view clip start and end by 10x
Ruthie Technically, you could just increase Clip End but that can result in artifacts caused by numerical precision.
Ruthie Really, you need to? I think you just want to use Blender.


Ruthie @Ruthie

Correct. My wording was incorrect.

Hello!
Is there an easy way to 'gridify' a shape?
Something like this.. 2 objects... one is a regular grid and another is just a shape..., i'd like to 'gridify' this shape

What is happening?!


Ethan-Hall @Ethan-Hall

Ruthie No, you are not doing it right. That is not how you multiply by 10.


Ruthie @Ruthie
20:12
than multiply 0.1 by ten you mean?


Ethan-Hall @Ethan-Hall
20:14
Multiply each of these values by 10

Like this? When I try to type 10,000 for End, it turns to 10.

I have a feeling I am doing this wrong. ðŸ˜‘


Ethan-Hall @Ethan-Hall

Ruthie Because in many other languages/countries a comma is used the same as we would use a decimal point.


Ruthie @Ruthie
20:18
Oh, I see. So what should I type instead?


Ethan-Hall @Ethan-Hall

Ruthie 10000

Ok.
Yes! It is fixed. Thank you so much! I appreciate you being patient with me. I acknowledge that I suck at Blender and I am a complete newbie, so thank you so much!

Recently I started using linked objects and I noticed that Blender doesn't directly show dimensions for them in the navigation bar N -> Item > Transform. Why? Can this be solved?

How is this Active Clip supposed to work? I select a video file opened in the Movie Clip editor, but it doesn't show up in the viewport or in renders?

I was using a mirror modifier to model this one shoe and then applied it. Say that I'm finished how do I get the other side of the shoe so my character can wear it. Or do I have to follow the tutorial to produce the other side again? Or is there a way I can copy and paste then flip or mirror? Right now when I mirror nothing is happening. I need both side:( and don't want to redo haha or would it leave me with two right or two left shoe?
